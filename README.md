# Waze-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting user churn for the Waze app, a widely-used navigation tool. User churn is defined as the number of users who have uninstalled or stopped using the Waze app over a specific period, in this case, monthly churn. By developing a churn prediction model, the project aims to help Waze identify users at high risk of leaving the platform, understand the factors contributing to churn, and enhance user retention strategies. This initiative is a key part of Waze's broader effort to foster growth and ensure long-term user satisfaction.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Build a DataFrame for the Churn Dataset: Create a structured DataFrame that will serve as the foundation for further analysis.

Examine Data Types: Investigate and summarize the data types of each column within the dataset.

Gather Descriptive Statistics: Compile and review descriptive statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset.

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Organize the data to prepare for a deeper analysis of potential factors influencing user churn.

Develop Insights and Recommendations: Identify patterns and trends within the data, and provide actionable recommendations to Waze leadership on improving user retention.

# Project Deliverables
PACE Strategy Document: Complete the questions outlined in the Course 2 PACE strategy document to ensure a well-structured approach to the project.

Jupyter Notebook: Answer specific questions and conduct preparatory coding work within the project's Jupyter notebook.

Column Dtypes Summary: Summarize the data types of the columns to ensure a clear understanding of the dataset's structure.

Executive Summary: Communicate the key findings and insights derived from the data analysis in a concise and clear executive summary, tailored to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

# Future Work
The project can be extended by:

Developing and validating a predictive model for user churn.
Identifying and visualizing key features that contribute to churn.
Implementing proactive engagement strategies for high-risk users based on model predictions.
